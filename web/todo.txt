- Make nodes smaller? given shrunk the height of each link. Maybe an overall scaling issue?
- Add more padding to each node
- Floating numbers at links based on throughput
- Prettier font
- Fixed colors for nodes and links based on resource being transmitted

- Enable splitting + merging nodes together in UI of same resource
- Merging different resource nodes together (utilize back-end model of a ResourceFlow)

Ambitious:
- Right now, expect graph data to be driven by Python script
- Eventually can be all computed, interactive on front-end
